  <description>The AT-44 is a ghost of a weapon. Forged by the legendary Fedorov during the final throes of Old Earth’s bloodiest war, it was an ambitious attempt to bridge the gap between precision and suppression.
  
But on the ancient testing grounds, the weapon fractured. Its mechanism was too advanced for the era's metallurgy and it was discarded as a fragile failure, buried by time while simpler weapons conquered the world.

Yet the Rim is a place of second chances. Salvaged from the corrupted memory banks of a derelict freighter, the AT-44 has been resurrected by smiths who value firepower over history. 
Rebuilt with modern alloys to fix its fatal flaws, it is no longer a failure but a beast unleashed. It kicks with the anger of a forgotten soldier and spits lead with a rhythmic, brutal reliability. A master’s rejected vision finally finding its true purpose at the edge of the universe.
