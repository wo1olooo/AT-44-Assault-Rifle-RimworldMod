    <label>AT44</label>
	<description>A volatile relic from Old Earth’s Second World War, the AT-44 was Fedorov’s failed attempt to harness the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Too fragile for its time, the design was abandoned until salvaged schematics were recovered from a crashed freighter. 
	
	Rebuilt with modern alloys, it is now a heavy, rhythmic beast. Though difficult to control, its raw stopping power is undeniable.

	A failed experiment resurrected to dominate the future.
